					<h3>Prasun Shrestha</h3>
					<p>Prasun Shrestha is a Master's student in Data Analytics at Heinz College, CMU. His experience is in predictive analytics, statistical modeling, and data visualizations. He has worked with several tech startups, non-profits, and many research projects as a data analyst, leveraging machine learning models to translate disparate data into actionable insights and help solve problems. From prior liberal arts education in Economics and Statistics, he brings communication and interpersonal skills as a consultant at dataCoLAB. Quintilingual and a former teacher, he distills and deconstructs complex ideas into digestible information that his audiences can understand intuitively. At dataCoLAB, he aspires to become immersed in experiential learning, apply his education to a real-world setting, and contribute to the data ecosystem.</p>

								<h3>Mike Simko</h3>
								<p>Mike Simko is currently an adjunct professor at CMU teaching the R language at the Heinz School, and has also taught data analytics classes remotely for the University of Texas - Austin. He works primarily with R, but also uses Python for data cleaning/wrangling, analysis and visualizations. Much of his background is in technology (specifically metals), but also has experience with process control, business / financial, social science and other types of datasets. He became interested in volunteering at dataCoLab to learn more skills and hopefully help others with their journeys in exploring data.</p>
